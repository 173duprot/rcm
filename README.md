# rcm - remove comments

![test](https://github.com/173duprot/rcm/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

This is a simple, hackable, rust program that removes comments using genericlly defined comment syntax. It's trivial to add support for more languages. By default it supports C, C++, C#, and Java.
