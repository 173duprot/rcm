# rcm - remove comments

![test](https://github.com/173duprot/rcm/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

This is a tiny elegant rust program that takes advantage of extremely compact functional syntax to remove C-like comments with very specifically defined behavior. Replacing the comment text with spaces, and leaving in newlines. It supports C, C++, C#, and Java.
